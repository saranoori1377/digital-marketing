# Data Description for E-commerce Sales Analysis

This document outlines the structure and description of the dataset used for the **"Predictive Modeling and Sentiment-Driven Recommendation System for Enhancing Customer Satisfaction in E-commerce"** project. The dataset consists of purchase records for different models of laptops and smartphones, along with customer ratings.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following key features:

| **Column Name**      | **Data Type** | **Description**                                              |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                 | Integer       | Unique identifier for each purchase transaction.              |
| `link`               | String        | URL link to the product page of the purchased item.           |
| `name`               | String        | Model name of the purchased laptop or smartphone.             |
| `price`              | Float         | The amount of money paid by the customer for the product.     |
| `rate`               | Float         | The rating given by the customer to the product (scale of 1-5).|
| `freesend`           | Boolean       | Indicates whether the product was delivered with free shipping (True/False).|

## Data Fields Explanation

- **`id`**: Each purchase is assigned a unique ID to differentiate transactions.
- **`link`**: The URL link to the specific product page on the online store, which allows tracking and easy access to the purchased product.
- **`name`**: Refers to the specific model or name of the product (e.g., laptop or smartphone) that the customer purchased. This is crucial for identifying popular models.
- **`price`**: The final price paid by the customer, including any discounts or promotions. It will be used to analyze pricing strategies and customer spending behavior.
- **`rate`**: The satisfaction level of the customer expressed as a numerical rating (1 to 5). This field is essential for sentiment analysis and understanding customer satisfaction.
- **`freesend`**: This field indicates whether free shipping was applied to the purchase, which can be used to study the impact of free delivery on customer satisfaction and purchase likelihood.

## Additional Notes

- **Data Quality**: Ensure the data has been cleaned, with missing or incorrect values addressed. For example, entries with invalid or missing `rate` should be handled appropriately.
- **Data Source**: The data is sourced from online sales records, reflecting real customer interactions with the e-commerce platform.

## Potential Use Cases for This Data

1. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: By linking `rate` with `name`, `price`, and `freesend`, we can analyze how product quality, pricing, and delivery options affect satisfaction levels.
2. **Sales Prediction**: The combination of `id`, `price`, and `name` can be used to build predictive models for future sales.
3. **Product Recommendation System**: By utilizing customer purchasing history (`id`, `name`), a personalized recommendation system can be built to suggest relevant products to users.
4. **Pricing and Shipping Strategy Insights**: Analyzing `price`, `freesend`, and their impact on ratings and repeat purchases can inform pricing and shipping optimization strategies.
